Requirements:

    You need to install ibus-table first.

Introduction:

    This repo is based on ibus-table-cangjie and was created mainly to
    test that changes made to the ibus-table code would work with a
    non-Chinese input character set.

    The data in tables/emoji.txt (which is concatenated from the two
    files in data/) was thoughtlessly generated from
    http://www.unicode.org/~scherer/emoji4unicode/snapshot/utc.html
    with minimal curation only to eliminate duplicate input sequences.

    The tree in its current form is not meant for real life use, due to
    obvious problems with the distribution of input characters.  Though
    all characters [a-f0-9] are allowed, there are only seven possible
    first characters [nhfpafs] which are the first initials of the seven
    top-level emoji categories in the draft spec above ([A]rtifacts was
    changed to  [P]roducts, and [A]bstract Concepts changed to [S]ignage
    and Symbols to avoid too many sequences beginning with 'a').  In a
    more thoughtful sequence tree, input characters at all positions
    would be more evenly distributed among allowed characters, and thus
    average keystrokes would be fewer.
